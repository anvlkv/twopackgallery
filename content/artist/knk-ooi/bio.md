hi, I'm knk_ooi

### who am I

I was born in April 1989. It was Monday afternoon.

I'm a beginner artist and developer of this website in my free time. My day job by coincidence is web-app design and development.

While I dreamed becoming a medicine doctor when I finished school I changed my mind and studied pattern-making and fashion design. My job later was in a design studio but one project made me change my mind by showing the disgusting sides of international fashion industry.

Leaving fashion behind, studying web development and design on my own took some time but I could get some clients rather quickly.

Later, thanks to my experience I found a job that fulfils my need to do something sensible in this world and allows me to live my life with some free time.

### artistic path

Back in childhood I might have liked drawing or even some 3d modeling but never considered it art just some landscapes and portraits which were fun to make. 

For several years film photography was my hobby. I mostly shoot with medium format mamiya and even got to try aerochrome. I've shared couple reels with my friends who were interested in photography.

Remembering batik lessons from my design school I tried that again in 2018 and later mixed it with cyanotype (an alternative photography process). Having fun with the different processes and effects I also explored how different textile holds and absorbs my paints and solutions.

Given the programming background I couldn't not have tried the generative and digital art. This one certainly was most therapeutic showing me how I'm getting side-tracked with my projects

I'm not looking to sell my art pieces I prefer to give them away to my dears. However, I'm open to artistic projects and collaborations

I like to work in large format, prefer textile as a main medium, mix of techniques, transformations

### twopack.gallery

My dear friend [kengie](/artist/kengie) inspired me to continue exploring the artistic path. Together with him we've decided to build the [twopack.gallery](https://twopack.gallery) - this website.

Being a HCD(human-centered design) practitioner I'm looking for the first audience of [artists and all the other roles](/about/#roles). 

To avoid deceiving anyone I shall say that we are now in stage of "wizard of oz" prototype. Which means we are fairly open and all ears to the audience needs. 

I realize participating in such experiment has little to offer but only promises. I promise to keep your work and bio on our website (or delete it upon your request) and to give you the voice in inviting next artists.
