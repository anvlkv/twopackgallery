hi, I'm Kengie

I was born in the early morning Friday the 13th. 1986

It was when watching an early 90s tv-show about Pablo Picasso that I felt I must become an artist.

I always liked drawing and painting even though my family made fun of me. Growing up in a village I didn't have much art schools around so I was learning to draw on my own.

Later I joined a college to become an art-teacher. I didn't finish... the opportunities for a young artist who just moved to a bigger city distracted me but maybe for good.

I stayed as a volunteer with disabled kids, helping them to lear art, doing art therapy

Many more times I moved to a different place participating in small local art shows, helping to organize them

Growing artist I sold some of my digital artworks as posters or t-shirt prints

My other dream was stage costume design and I joined circus. These were productive years where I created stage decorations and characters for their shows

Returning to painting I made copies of some grate masters to improve my technique

I like to work with oil on plywood or canvas of any format
